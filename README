This is the README file for Cato, a multi-language CRUD generator.

USAGE:

  If your database follows the normals Rails-like naming conventions you can 
  invoke this script like this:

    db gen model User

  If you don't (or can't) follow that convention you can invoke this script
  like this:

    db gen model User peeps

  where the generic invocations look like this:

    db gen model [ClassName]
    db gen model [ClassName] [table_name]

  Actually, that's a bit of a fib to make this app look more like Rails ... the 
  real invocations look like this:

    db gen [template-name] [ClassName]
    db gen [template-name] [ClassName] [table_name]

  The reason the earlier invocations work is that it's standard to have 
  templates named model.tpl, view.tpl, and controller.tpl, but in fact you can 
  have templates with all sorts of names:

    model.tpl
    view.tpl
    controller.tpl
    applicationContext.tpl
    hibernate.tpl
    whatever-you-want.tpl
