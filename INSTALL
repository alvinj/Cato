INSTALLATION:

To install Cato just follow these steps. Note that Cato depends on the
MDB2 PHP PEAR package, and also the Smarty templating engine.

1) If you don't already have PHP installed, install it.

2) Install the PHP PEAR package MDB2. This is needed for database access.

3) Install the Smarty templating software (http://www.smarty.net/).
   Smarty is used for all template processing.

4) Install this application somewhere in your filesystem, like this:

   /Users/al/Cato
   
5) Modify your PATH to include our bin directory

   PATH=/Users/al/Cato/bin:$PATH

6) Create an alias to our db.php script to make it easier to run:

   alias db=/Users/al/Cato/bin/db.php

7) Copy the 'example' directory somewhere you'd like to work in for
   your application. For instance, if you're working on a project named
   Foo in a directory named /Users/al/Projects/Foo, copy the examples
   directory and rename it like this:
   
   /Users/al/Projects/Foo/cato
   
8) Modify the app.config file to work for your application. The main thing
   you need to configure are the database parameters. Everything after that
   is technically optional, though I'm sure you'll want to customize things
   for your project. You'll almost certainly want to modify the files in
   the 'templates' directory to match your preferences.

If everything has gone well, congratulations, you should be ready to run 
database CRUD commands, as shown in our README file.
