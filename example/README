The Cato "example" Directory

This directory contains the files needed to configure Cato to
access your database and generate CRUD files based on your table
definitions.

---++ Template Files

The template files used to generate the CRUD are located in this
subdirectory:

  templates

If you haven't already done so, you'll want to configure Cato
so you can use it. Please see the Cato INSTALL document for 
more information on that process, and see the Cato README
document for information on how to use Cato.

---++ Configuring Cato

If you haven't already done so, you'll want to configure your
shell so it can find Cato, something like this:

  PATH=/Users/al/bin/cato:$PATH
  alias db=/Users/al/bin/cato/db.php
